# cPanel to SiteHost Containers Migration Tool

This tool has been built to automate website migrations from cPanel速 servers (Source) to SiteHost Cloud Container servers (Destination).

This bash script leverages the [SiteHost API](https://docs.sitehost.nz/api/v1.1/) and [WHM API 1](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/whm/introduction/) to replicate the account's hosting environment on the Source to the Destination. We make use of rsync, ssh and other magic commands to put data in place rebuilding the website/account on the Destination server.

**This is a Work in Progress.** Still, can probably help you and save lots of time on migrations from cPanel速 to Cloud Containers.

# Known issues, limitations and requirements

- The tool has been designed to run on the cPanel速 (Source) server
- Root SSH access to the Source hosting server is required
- Designed to migrate PHP based applications only
- MySQL secrets cannot be retrieved from the Source server so you must reconfigure your website database credentials to get it working on the Destination
- There's no metadata to correlate databases and domains on the Source server but you can interact with the tool to selectively copy data over
- SiteHost API key with access to Cloud, Job and Server modules is required. SiteHost support can provide you with one

You may need to install a few extra packages on the Source server:

```
yum install jq oniguruma rsync curl sshpass
```

# Usage

Copy the `cpanel-to-cc.sh` script to the Source server. You can make it executable and run or invoke bash:

```
chmod u+x cpanel-to-cc.sh
./cpanel-to-cc.sh --help
```

```
bash cpanel-to-cc.sh --help
```
