# cPanel to SiteHost Containers Migration Tool

This tool has been built to automate website migrations from cPanel速 servers (Source) to SiteHost Cloud Container servers (Destination).

This bash script leverages the [SiteHost API](https://docs.sitehost.nz/api/v1.1/) and [WHM API 1](https://api.docs.cpanel.net/whm/introduction/) to replicate the account's hosting environment on the Source to the Destination. We make use of rsync, ssh and other magic commands to put data in place rebuilding the website/account on the Destination server.

**This is a Work in Progress.** Still, can probably help you and save lots of time on migrations from cPanel速 to Cloud Containers.

# Known issues, limitations and requirements

- The tool has been designed to run on a cPanel速 server as a Source server
- Root SSH access to the Source server is required
- The tool has been designed to migrate PHP + MySQL applications only
- MySQL secrets cannot be retrieved from the Source server so you must reconfigure your website database credentials to get it working on the Destination
- There's no metadata to correlate databases and domains on the Source server but you can interact with the tool to selectively copy data over
- SiteHost API key with access to Cloud, Job and Server modules is required. SiteHost support can provide you with one

You may need to install a few extra packages on the Source server:

```
yum install jq oniguruma rsync curl sshpass
```

# Supported versions

We expect the tool to work on any cPanel server running CentOS 6 or newer. We have also tested it on CloudLinux servers. The oldest WHM version tested was v76.0.22.

The tool won't work on bash older than v4.
 

# Usage

Copy the `cpanel-to-cc.sh` script to the Source server. You can make it executable and run or invoke bash:

```
chmod u+x cpanel-to-cc.sh
./cpanel-to-cc.sh --help
```

```
bash cpanel-to-cc.sh --help
```

The `help` instructions has a list of all valid arguments, options and also usage examples.

If you did not connect to the Destination server from the Source server yet, try connecting before copying data over to ensure the Destination is added to the list of known hosts.


Expected output:
```
[root@cloudlinux ~]# ./cpanel-to-cc.sh --client-id 123654 --domain example.co --assume-yes
=> Run log available at: /tmp/cpanel-to-cc/run.log
All done!

=> SFTP/SSH credentials for users created at: /tmp/cpanel-to-cc/sftp.csv
=> Database and Database user credentials created at: /tmp/cpanel-to-cc/databases.csv
```
